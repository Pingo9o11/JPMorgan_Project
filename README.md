# Income Prediction & Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes demographic and employment factors associated with earning more or less than $50K annually using U.S. Census data. The goal is to identify key drivers of income, address class imbalance, and build robust predictive models suitable for marketing focussed decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset is derived from the U.S. Census Adult Income dataset and includes demographic, educational, and employment-related attributes. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether an individual earns more than $50K per year.


## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured pipeline:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and nonlinear patterns
- Feature preprocessing including scaling and encoding
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE and class weighting
- Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression and XGBoost
- Segmentation Modeling and Evaluation

## Modeling
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest (baseline, interpretable)
- XGBoost with regularization
- Hyperparameters selected to balance performance and generalization

## Evaluation
Models are evaluated on a held-out test set using:
- Accuracy
- ROC-AUC
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion matrix
- Probability-based ROC curves for threshold analysis



## Results
Random Forest delivered the most balanced overall performance, combining strong ROC-AUC with stable precision, recall and interpretability making it the most holistic model for this use case. XGBoost also performed very well, especially in detecting high-income individuals (minority class), but its higher variance and lower stability across metrics made it slightly less suitable for broad deployment. The final cluster summaries further reveal distinct demographic and employment patterns that align closely with income levels, supporting targeted segmentation and marketing strategies.
